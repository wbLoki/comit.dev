## Usage

### Generating a Commit Message

To generate a commit message, ensure your changes are staged, then run the following command:

```bash
comit
```

This command will run git ``diff --staged``, send the diff to your selected AI agent (you can choose or change the agent in the [dashboard](https://comit.dev/dashboard)), and generate several commit message suggestions for you formatted according to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).


A sample output might look like:

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Select commit message:
  > Refresh
    feat: add pagination support to /users endpoint
    fix: resolve 500 error when POST /login is called without payload
    chore: refactor API route handlers for better modularity
    docs: update API reference with new pagination and auth examples
```

### Live Chat with Your Selected Agent
Start a live conversation with your preferred AI assistant:
```bash
comit live
```
You'll be prompted to chat and can ask for code, advice, or assistance:
```bash
give a function that returns the sum of two numbers in python

def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

> now in rust


fn sum(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
a + b
}
```

### Generate a Branch Name
Automatically generate a branch name based on a description:
```bash
comit -b "Add a New Feature to the User Profile Page"
# output
# feature/add-new-feature-user-profile-page
# bugfix/save-button-not-working-settings-page
```

### Send a Prompt
Use a one-off prompt without entering chat mode:
```bash
comit -c "what is the meaning of life"
```
